Chit Chat is an anonymous chat application for the 21st century.  Built on PHP, AngularJS, and hard work, Chit Chat provides a single thread of real-time communication complete with (dis)likes, quoting, and mentioning! Enjoy chatting and please be on your best behavior!

Disclaimer: This was built as a class project and, as such, is not a production-ready site. It targets an outdated version of PHP as that is what we had access to at the time.  The security of this site was reasonable for the constraints of the project, but is not acceptable for a production site.  Due to time constraints and other priorities, I will not likely be updating the site with better security. That said **DO NOT** use anything similar to your normal email/password combination on this site.
